# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
## Project Description
TThis project serves as the front-end component of a CSV file validator. Its primary purpose is to validate CSV files directly on the client side. 

The project's main functionality revolves around identifying missing column names and presenting them as errors at the top of the page. Additionally, it validates field formats based on predefined rules. For instance, it verifies whether a field is a number, string, or empty.

In future releases, we plan to enhance the project by introducing custom rule files. This enhancement will allow users to define their validation rules, enabling validation of CSV files as well as other file formats. Moreover, we aim to implement browser-level error validation to provide end-users with immediate feedback. This functionality will empower users to make necessary changes to resolve errors promptly.
